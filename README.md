# 🎮 Guessing Game in Rust

This is a simple command-line game written in Rust where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.

## 🧠 How it works

- The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
- The player is asked to guess the number.
- After each guess, the game will tell if the guess is too low, too high, or correct.
- The game continues in a loop until the correct number is guessed.
- Invalid inputs (like letters or symbols) are handled gracefully.

## 🛠 How to Run

Make sure you have Rust installed. If not, install it from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

```bash
cargo run
